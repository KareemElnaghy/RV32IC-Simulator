## Project Overview
This project is a RISC-V RV32IC Base Integer Instruction Set simulator with support for instruction compression (bonus). The simulator reads RV32I machine code, decodes each instruction, translates it into a string that represents a true RV32I instruction, prints it on the terminal, and executes the decoded instruction.
